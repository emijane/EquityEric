- The cost of health insurance varies mainly based on a combination of monthly premiums and out-of-pocket costs. The more you're willing to pay out of pocket for care, the lower those monthly rates will be.
- That means the most inexpensive health insurance plans are those with higher deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments. That makes shopping for affordable healthcare a balancing act between what you pay every month and what you will have to pay if you need care.
- Fortunately, there are programs and plans aimed at making affordable health insurance accessible.
- Individual health plans are available in the ACA marketplace and outside the marketplace.
- The ACA exchanges are designed to help people find the most affordable health insurance that meets their needs. The plans on the exchanges must meet specified criteria, such as covering ten essential health benefits, including prescription drugs, outpatient, hospitalization, and mental health.
- The federal government also offers low-income health insurance tax credits and subsidies. If your household income is between 100-400% of the federal poverty level, you are likely eligible for subsidies to make ACA health insurance cheaper. That’s about $12,880 to $51,520 for an individual and $26,500 to $106,000 for a family of four.
- According to Dr. Kevin Griffith, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University's Department of Health Policy, people too often fail to take advantage of this kind of government assistance. He notes that "Many uninsured individuals are eligible for generous subsidies, but either don't realize it or do not take advantage of them."
- You'll be asked to submit your household income information when shopping on the ACA exchanges’ website. The tool provides options that consider subsidies, so you you’ll know what to expect to pay in premiums.
- The ACA marketplace classifies plans by metal tiers: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum.
- The most affordable health insurance in the ACA marketplace in terms of premiums are Bronze plans.
- These have the lowest premiums but the highest deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. A Bronze plan generally costs less initially but requires more in out-of-pocket expenses than the other plans for healthcare services. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), the lowest cost Bronze plan in 2023 averages $342 a month.
- Platinum plans have the highest premiums but the lowest out-of-pocket costs and deductibles.
- Silver plans typically have higher premiums than Bronze. However, if you qualify for subsidies, you may find a Silver plan that's actually cheaper than a Bronze plan. A Silver plan has lower out-of-pocket costs than Bronze. So, if you qualify for subsidies, a Silver plan might be a better bet than a Bronze plan. The KFF reports an average monthly cost of $448 a month for the lowest-cost Silver plan.
- However, if you don't qualify for subsidies, ACA plans can be more expensive than an employer-sponsored plan. In that case, you may want to look for an individual plan outside of the marketplace. Plans outside of the exchanges don't have as many requirements and can be more affordable than ACA plans.
- You can look for an individual plan outside of the exchanges by checking with an independent health insurance broker or going directly to area health insurers.
- If you shop for a plan outside of the exchanges, check its coverage, so you know what to expect before signing up.
- An affordable plan can be found on healthcare.gov, which is the ACA exchange’s website. The site asks you to enter information such as where you live and your family income. With that information, the tool provides health plan options and premium estimates.
- An affordable plan can be achievd by choosing an HMO over a PPO. HMOs are cheaper but offer the same coverage. HMOs, however, require referrals to see specialists and you're only able to see doctors in the HMO's network.
- A more affordable plan can achieved by buying bronze plan, especially if you don't need to see a doctor often over the next year
- If you qualify for subsidies, a Silver plan can wind up costing as little as a Bronze plan, but has lower out-of-pocket costs.
- If you can't find an affordable plan on the exchanges, check with individual health insurers in your area for options outside of the exchanges.
- If you are uninsured, you may be eligible for government-funded programs such as Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).
- If you are uninsured, You may also be able to access free or low-cost healthcare at community health clinics or through programs such as the Indian Health Service for Native Americans.
- For uninsured individuals, some hospitals and medical facilities may offer financial assistance or sliding scale fees based on their income.
- uninsured people may also look into purchasing a short-term health insurance plan or a healthcare sharing ministry plan as a temporary solution.
- Another option for seeing a doctor when you don’t have insurance is to check within your community for a free healthcare center. A community healthcare center usually has primary care doctors, mental health doctors, pharmacies, and even oral care doctors.
- Uninsured and underinsured consumers may have different health insurance coverage options to consider. In fact, about half of all uninsured consumers are eligible for but not enrolled in either Medicaid or health insurance coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace® with financial assistance. As an assister, you should explore these options with consumers.
- Charity care programs help uninsured patients who cannot afford to pay their medical bills and do not qualify for government aid
- Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) provide free or low-cost healthcare coverage for eligible individuals and families.
- Community health clinics: Community health clinics provide free or low-cost healthcare services to underserved communities and those without funds to pay for healthcare costs.
- Some government programs provide subsidies to help lower the cost of health insurance for individuals and families who meet certain income requirements.
- Programs from government agencies and pharmaceutical companies can help you pay for prescription drugs. Check with each program to find out if you’re eligible and how to apply.
- If you lose your job or your employer-sponsored health insurance coverage, you may be eligible for COBRA continuation coverage. This allows you to continue your coverage for a certain period of time, but you'll have to pay the full premium yourself.
- Most insurance companies have a provider directory on their website that you can use to search for doctors, hospitals, and other healthcare providers who accept your plan.
- If you're not sure how to find a provider on your insurance company's website, you can call the customer service number on the back of your insurance card and ask for help finding a provider who accepts your plan
- If you have a primary care doctor, they may be able to refer you to specialists or other healthcare providers who accept your insurance.
- Some websites, such as Healthgrades.com and Yelp.com, allow you to search for healthcare providers by insurance plan.
- If you have employer-sponsored insurance, your employer may be able to provide you with a list of healthcare providers who accept your plan.
- Check with your state insurance department: Some states have directories of healthcare providers who accept Medicaid or other state-funded insurance programs.
- One way of reducing out-of-pocket healthcare expenses is by taking advantage of existing low-cost preventative-care services. Many insurance plans offer preventative care services, such as annual check-ups and screenings, at no cost to you. Taking advantage of these services can help you catch and treat health issues early, which can save you money in the long run.
- Prices for procedures and medications can vary widely between providers and pharmacies. Do some research and compare prices before you schedule a procedure or fill a prescription.
- Most insurance plans have a network of providers that they have negotiated lower rates with. Using in-network providers can save you money on your out-of-pocket expenses.
- One thing to consider if you want to lower out-of-pocker expenses is HDHPs. HDHPs typically have lower monthly premiums, but higher out-of-pocket costs. However, if you're generally healthy and don't expect to have many medical expenses, an HDHP may be a good option for you.
- Generic drugs are cheaper than brand-name drugs, and they are just as effective. Ask your doctor if a generic alternative is available for any prescription they write for you.
- Take advantage of health savings account (HSA) or flexible spending account (FSA). HSAs and FSAs are tax-advantaged savings accounts that can be used to pay for out-of-pocket healthcare expenses.
- Look for discounts and programs for people with low income: Some pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, and other healthcare providers offer discounts and programs for people with low income.
- Some health plans offer health advocates or case managers. A health advocate can help you get the most of your benefits. A case manager can help you to manage complex health problems such as diabetes or asthma.
- Get routine health screenings. These tests can catch health problems early, when they may be more easily treated. And you often do not have to pay a copay for health screenings, vaccines, and annual well visits.
- Out-of-network providers are the doctors and facilities that do not have a direct affiliation with your health insurance company. Out-of-network care, either through a physician visit or during an emergency, is usually more expensive. Getting a health insurance plan with out-of-network coverage can help you avoid some surprise medical bills, and this type of coverage is worth it for people who want to maximize their health care choices or who have specialized medical needs.
- When you use in-network providers, you typically pay less out-of-pocket than you would if you used out-of-network providers. The costs for using out-of-network providers can be significantly higher and sometimes not covered by insurance.
- When you choose a health plan, it's important to check whether the providers you currently use or plan to use in the future are in-network. If you see a provider who is not in-network, you will likely pay more for their services. This is why it's a good idea to check your insurance company's provider directory before scheduling an appointment.
- Additionally, some insurance plans have a tiered network, which means that different providers are grouped into different levels, with different levels having different copayments and co-insurance. You will generally pay less out of pocket for providers in the highest level of your plan's network.
- It's important to check the network status of any providers before scheduling an appointment, and also to check if there are any additional costs for using providers out of network.
- It's always a good idea to check with your insurance company to understand how your plan's network affects your healthcare costs and to ensure you are aware of all the options available to you, including the costs for using out-of-network providers. Some plans have more flexibility than others. It is also important to be aware of any penalties for using out of network providers, as well as the coverage limits for out of network care.
- You can be charged with out-of-network costs when care is provided and the medical provider has not agreed to a negotiated fee with your insurance provider. This means medical providers may charge the full amount for your treatment and your insurance provider may not pay for these charges, leaving the full burden of payment up to you. Avoid being surprised by costs associated with out-of-network fees by educating yourself on your plans limitations and additional payment options.
- Your insurance plan's deductibles and copays can have a significant impact on your healthcare costs.
- A deductible is the amount you have to pay before your insurance plan begins to cover the costs of your healthcare services. For example, if your deductible is $1,000, you will have to pay the first $1,000 of your healthcare costs out of your own pocket before your insurance plan begins to cover the remaining costs.
- Copays, on the other hand, are a fixed dollar amount that you pay for a specific healthcare service, regardless of the actual cost of the service. For example, if your copay for a doctor's visit is $20, you will pay $20 for each visit, even if the actual cost of the visit is $100.
- It is important to understand how your plan's deductibles and copays work together and how they can affect your overall healthcare costs. Some plans have higher deductibles but lower copays, while others have lower deductibles but higher copays. Additionally, some plans may have no deductibles at all, but higher copays.
- It's also important to check if your plan has any out-of-pocket maximums, which is the most you would have to pay for covered services in a year. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, your insurance plan will cover all of your remaining costs for the rest of the year.
- It's always a good idea to check with your insurance company to understand how your plan's deductibles and copays affect your healthcare costs and to ensure you are aware of all the options available to you.
- Once you've reached your deductible, you typically pay a copayment or coinsurance for all services covered by your plan. The insurance company takes care of payment for the remaining balance. The amount of the copay depends on your health insurance and the type of service you're receiving
- Copays are typically associated more with managed care plans such as HMOs. Insurance companies that offer HMO plans have contracts with healthcare providers that let them pay fixed fees for essential healthcare services. It’s easier to predict overall costs and to offer health insurance copay system to health insurance consumers.
- There are several ways to compare healthcare costs between different providers and facilities:
- Check with your insurance company: Many insurance companies have cost-comparison tools on their websites that allow you to compare the costs of different providers and facilities. These tools will typically show you the estimated cost of a specific procedure or service and will include information about deductibles, copays, and out-of-pocket costs.
- Use online cost-comparison tools: There are several online cost-comparison tools that allow you to compare the costs of different providers and facilities. These tools will typically show you the estimated cost of a specific procedure or service and will include information about deductibles, copays, and out-of-pocket costs.
- Ask the providers directly: Contact the providers and facilities directly and ask them for the cost of a specific procedure or service. Make sure to ask about any additional costs that may not be included in the initial estimate, such as lab fees or medications.
- Check with a healthcare navigator or counselor: Some organizations provide free or low-cost healthcare navigation services that can help you compare costs and find affordable healthcare options. They can also help you understand your insurance coverage and answer any questions you may have about healthcare costs.
- When you compare costs, make sure to consider not only the price, but also the quality of care, the reputation of the facility, and the experience of the provider. Additionally, make sure to check the network status of the providers, as well as any additional costs for using providers out of network.
- Look for a summary of benefits. Online marketplaces usually provide a link to the summary of benefits, which explains all the plan's costs and coverages. A provider directory, which lists the doctors and clinics that participate in the plan’s network, should also be available. If you’re going through an employer, ask your workplace benefits administrator for the summary of benefits.
- Weigh your family’s medical needs. Look at the amount and type of treatment you’ve received in the past. Though it’s impossible to predict every medical expense, being aware of trends can help you make an informed decision.
- Compare out-of-pocket costs via Copay, Coinsurance, Deductibles, Out-of-pocket maximums, Out-of-pocket costs, and premiums
- a few tips on how to negotiate healthcare costs with your provider or insurance company are
- Be prepared: Before you negotiate, gather all the information you have about the cost of the service or procedure, including any estimates or bills you have received. Also, be familiar with your insurance plan's coverage and any out-of-pocket expenses you are responsible for.
- Ask for a breakdown of the costs: Ask your provider or insurance company for a detailed breakdown of the costs associated with the service or procedure. This will help you understand what you are paying for and where the costs are coming from.
- Check if the service is covered by your insurance plan: Before you negotiate, check if the service or procedure is covered by your insurance plan. If it is not covered, ask your provider if they offer any discounts or payment plans.
- Look for alternative options: If the cost of a service or procedure is too high, ask your provider or insurance company if there are any alternative options that may be more affordable.
- Negotiate with your provider: If the cost of a service or procedure is still too high, try to negotiate with your provider. Explain your financial situation and ask if they can offer a discount or a more affordable payment plan.
- Talk with your insurance company: If you are unable to reach an agreement with your provider, contact your insurance company and ask if they can help negotiate the cost.
- It's important to remember that healthcare costs can be complex and there may not always be room for negotiation. Be prepared for the possibility that the cost cannot be lowered but it's always worth asking and checking.
- The most important thing to remember when negotiating your medical bills is to start the process early. It’s much more challenging to negotiate payment terms when it’s close to being due rather than having weeks to work with.
- When reviewing your bill, check for any errors that might have been made when the hospital entered your costs and services for billing. Errors on medical bills are more common than you might think.
- Some reports estimate that as many as 80% of medical bills contain a billing error and up 25% of skilled nursing facilities’ claims will be overpaid because of errors made on a patient’s medical bill.
- Once you’ve cleared up any errors on your bill, the next step is to look into any financial assistance programs your healthcare provider or hospital may off.
- The federal government and state laws require many hospitals and health systems to offer financial assistance to patients who can’t afford their medical bills as long as the service is considered “medically necessary.” This includes inpatient hospital stays and emergency room visits.
- If you don't qualify for your healthcare provider's financial assistance programs, or they don't offer any, you'll want to start researching the “insured” rate for the services you've received.
- Hospital and clinic bills are usually interest-free, unlike your monthly credit card bill. So paying off a monthly payment to your hospital will be more affordable in the long run than making monthly payments on your credit card to try and pay off your medical bill.
- Healthcare costs can vary significantly depending on location. Factors that can affect healthcare costs include the cost of living in a particular area, the availability of healthcare providers and facilities, and regional differences in healthcare policies and regulations.
- Regional Differences: Healthcare costs can vary greatly between different regions of the country. For example, healthcare costs in urban areas tend to be higher than in rural areas due to a higher cost of living and a greater availability of healthcare providers and facilities.
- State regulations: Some state have more regulations on healthcare costs and prices than others, and this can affect the costs of healthcare services and procedures.
- Competition: In areas with a high concentration of healthcare providers and facilities, there is often more competition, which can lead to lower prices for healthcare services.
- Insurance Coverage: The cost of healthcare can also vary depending on the type of insurance coverage a person has. For example, people with private insurance may pay more out-of-pocket for healthcare services than those with government-funded insurance.
- Cost of Living: The cost of living also affects healthcare costs. In areas where the cost of living is high, healthcare costs tend to be higher as well.
- It's also important to note that within a specific location, healthcare costs can vary widely even among providers and facilities. It's important to compare costs and quality of care, and to make sure you understand your insurance coverage so that you can make informed decisions about your healthcare.
- Healthcare costs can vary significantly depending on the type of treatment or procedure a person needs. Some treatments and procedures are more complex and costly than others.
- Prescription Drugs: The cost of prescription drugs can vary widely depending on the type of drug and whether it is brand name or generic. Brand-name drugs are typically more expensive than generic drugs.
- Medical Devices: The cost of medical devices, such as prosthetic limbs, can also vary widely. These costs can be affected by the type of device, the materials used, and the level of customization required.
- Surgery: The cost of surgery can vary depending on the type of procedure, the complexity of the surgery, and the facility where the surgery is performed. Some surgeries are more complex and require specialized equipment and facilities, which can drive up the cost.
- Radiology and lab tests: The cost of radiology and lab tests can also vary depending on the type of test and the facility where it is performed.
- Outpatient vs Inpatient: Outpatient services are typically less expensive than inpatient services, as the latter require an overnight stay in a hospital.
- Chronic illness: Treating chronic illness such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer, can be very expensive, as it often involves a combination of medications, lab tests, and regular doctor visits over a long period of time.
- It's important to note that the costs of healthcare can vary greatly, even within the same treatment type. It's important to understand your insurance coverage and to compare costs and quality of care when making decisions about your healthcare.
- Health insurance helps you save money by enabling you to transfer a big financial risk to the insurer in exchange for a (comparatively) small premium.
- I'm not saying that health insurance isn't expensive. Health insurance costs have been rising faster than overall inflation and worker earnings for years. 
- I'm just saying that not having health insurance can be financially devastating.
- For example, imagine how expensive it would be to cover the costs of staying in the hospital or paying for a trip to the emergency room. 
- You could easily rack up a bill in the thousands, potentially costing all of your savings—or more!
- What are the options and strategies to help lower your costs?
- Like clothing, there is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to health insurance. 
- Choices abound, so it's important to think carefully about your own needs and the needs of your family before you decide.
- Once you have insurance, make sure to review your coverage annually or if you have a major life change like getting married or moving to a new community.
- Understanding health insurance isn't easy, so don't hesitate to ask for help from your employer, an advisor, or someone you trust.
- What are coverage options for young people?
- Under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), young people are now able to stay under a parent's plan if it covers dependents until the age of 26. 
- This can be the case even if you're married, not living with your parents, or have left school. 
- Check with your parent's plan about specific enrollment periods.
- Students still in college may be able to find health insurance through a student health plan. 
- This can be an affordable option, but be sure to check to see if the coverage counts as "qualifying coverage". 
- Otherwise, there might be more limited benefits or certain exclusions. That being said, a student plan might be a backup option if you can't be covered through a parent's plan.
- what are coverage options for workers?
- About half of Americans have health coverage through work.
- This type of coverage is often subsidized by the employer to help reduce the costs to employees.
- You may have more than one option with different premiums, co-pays, and deductibles as well as access to a different network of health professionals, so take the time to determine the best fit.
- Make sure to consider health insurance when you're changing jobs and during your employer's enrollment period when you can make changes.
- High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP)/Health Savings Accounts (HSAs)
- HDHPs offer lower monthly premiums, but have higher deductibles.
- An HDHP/HSA combo can be a great choice for people who don't use medical services a lot and can help you save money by allowing you to pay for out-of-pocket health costs tax-free.
- The mistake that I often see people enrolled in HDHPs make is neglecting to use the cost savings from the lower premiums to fund an HSA. 
- If you sign up for an HDHP, make sure you 1) Open up an HSA. 2) Fund it every month. 3) Put your savings to work by investing your savings when possible.
- Coverage if you're self-employed or a small business owner
- If you're part of the growing "gig" economy, working as a contractor, your own boss, or you own a small business, make sure to check out options available through healthcare.gov.
- You may also be eligible for a tax break by deducting the cost of health insurance as a business expense to help lower your costs. Check with a tax advisor for details.
- Health insurance helps secure your financial future
- For many young adults like yourself, paying for your own health insurance coverage is something new and may seem like it's not important. 
- But the opposite is actually the case. Having good health insurance is one of the most crucial pieces to your financial plan. 
- It's vital to your financial health by helping protect you from financial calamity. 
- In fact, having the right kind and the right amount of health insurance is one of the smartest money moves you can make.
- Health insurance will protect you financially
- If there is an accident, the insurance company will help cover some of the costs
- If you don’t already have health insurance, you may think you don’t need it. But what happens if you’re in a car accident or your husband falls off of a ladder? 
- What if you are depressed and you didn’t seek counseling because it was too expensive? 
- Did you know that a trip to the emergency room can cost more than a month’s rent-- over $1200? 
- Then what happens if you get hospitalized, and you need some medical care for a monthor more? It’s a gamble that is not worth taking. 
- With insurance, you can manage these events that could affect you or your family. 
- Without insurance, these bills will add up fast, they’ll be devastating and they will cost too much.
- Essential Health Benefits
- Every plan sold in the Marketplace includes these benefits
- No matter what type of insurance you have, your plan is required to help you pay for 10 important health services. 
- They are called Essential Health Benefits. They include:
- Outpatient care—the kind you get without being admitted to a hospital
- Lab tests
- Prescription medicines
- Preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management—such as education about how to manage your diabetes
- Trips to the emergency room—This is for very serious problems that cannot wait, (like broken bones,
- heart attacks, bad accidents). If you show up in the Emergency Room and it’s not that serious, your
- insurance might not cover it.
- Hospitalizations (such as surgery) —This is when you are admitted and you get treatment in the hospitalfor inpatient care.
- Care before and after your baby is born
- Help with mental health issues, drug or alcohol abuse, counseling and therapy
- Services and devices to help you recover if you are injured, or have a disability or chronic condition—things like physical and occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, and psychiatric rehabilitation
