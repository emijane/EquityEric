- The cost of health insurance varies mainly based on a combination of monthly premiums and out-of-pocket costs. The more you're willing to pay out of pocket for care, the lower those monthly rates will be.
- That means the most inexpensive health insurance plans are those with higher deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments. That makes shopping for affordable healthcare a balancing act between what you pay every month and what you will have to pay if you need care. 
- Fortunately, there are programs and plans aimed at making affordable health insurance accessible.
- Individual health plans are available in the ACA marketplace and outside the marketplace.
- The ACA exchanges are designed to help people find the most affordable health insurance that meets their needs. The plans on the exchanges must meet specified criteria, such as covering ten essential health benefits, including prescription drugs, outpatient, hospitalization, and mental health.
- The federal government also offers low-income health insurance tax credits and subsidies. If your household income is between 100-400% of the federal poverty level, you are likely eligible for subsidies to make ACA health insurance cheaper. That’s about $12,880 to $51,520 for an individual and $26,500 to $106,000 for a family of four.
- According to Dr. Kevin Griffith, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University's Department of Health Policy, people too often fail to take advantage of this kind of government assistance. He notes that "Many uninsured individuals are eligible for generous subsidies, but either don't realize it or do not take advantage of them."
- You'll be asked to submit your household income information when shopping on the ACA exchanges’ website. The tool provides options that consider subsidies, so you you’ll know what to expect to pay in premiums.
- The ACA marketplace classifies plans by metal tiers: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum.
- The most affordable health insurance in the ACA marketplace in terms of premiums are Bronze plans.
- These have the lowest premiums but the highest deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. A Bronze plan generally costs less initially but requires more in out-of-pocket expenses than the other plans for healthcare services. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), the lowest cost Bronze plan in 2023 averages $342 a month.
- Platinum plans have the highest premiums but the lowest out-of-pocket costs and deductibles.
- Silver plans typically have higher premiums than Bronze. However, if you qualify for subsidies, you may find a Silver plan that's actually cheaper than a Bronze plan. A Silver plan has lower out-of-pocket costs than Bronze. So, if you qualify for subsidies, a Silver plan might be a better bet than a Bronze plan. The KFF reports an average monthly cost of $448 a month for the lowest-cost Silver plan.
- However, if you don't qualify for subsidies, ACA plans can be more expensive than an employer-sponsored plan. In that case, you may want to look for an individual plan outside of the marketplace. Plans outside of the exchanges don't have as many requirements and can be more affordable than ACA plans.
- You can look for an individual plan outside of the exchanges by checking with an independent health insurance broker or going directly to area health insurers.
- If you shop for a plan outside of the exchanges, check its coverage, so you know what to expect before signing up.
- An affordable plan can be found on healthcare.gov, which is the ACA exchange’s website. The site asks you to enter information such as where you live and your family income. With that information, the tool provides health plan options and premium estimates.
- An affordable plan can be achievd by choosing an HMO over a PPO. HMOs are cheaper but offer the same coverage. HMOs, however, require referrals to see specialists and you're only able to see doctors in the HMO's network.
- A more affordable plan can achieved by buying bronze plan, especially if you don't need to see a doctor often over the next year
- If you qualify for subsidies, a Silver plan can wind up costing as little as a Bronze plan, but has lower out-of-pocket costs.
- If you can't find an affordable plan on the exchanges, check with individual health insurers in your area for options outside of the exchanges.
